# AI Agent Guidelines for cpp_app

This file exists specifically to inform AI coding assistants (Claude, Copilot, Cursor,
ChatGPT, etc.) of the non-negotiable design principles for this project.

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Update Documentation With Every Change

**This is not optional. There are no exceptions.**

Any change to source code, `CMakeLists.txt`, `vcpkg.json`, GitHub Actions workflows,
or any other file in the repo triggers this rule. The following documentation files
must be checked and updated as needed:

- **`README.md`**
- **`AGENTS.md`**
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`**

Do not wait to be asked. Do not skip this step. A commit that changes behaviour
without updating the relevant documentation is incomplete.

### Pre-commit documentation checklist

Before every commit, run through the following mentally:

- [ ] Does `README.md` still accurately describe the build steps, supported platforms,
      and minimum versions?
- [ ] Does `README.md` have accurate unit test instructions for every platform touched?
- [ ] Does `ARCHITECTURE.md` still accurately describe the libraries, CI jobs, and
      design decisions?
- [ ] Does `AGENTS.md` reflect any new conventions or constraints introduced by this
      change?

## Core Principle: Maximum Binary Self-Containment

The single most important rule in this codebase is that **every release binary must be
as self-contained as possible**. See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the
detailed technical rationale behind this principle.

End-users should be able to download a release archive,
extract it, and run the executable without installing any additional software, libraries,
or runtimes.

**Never weaken this principle** when adding features, libraries, or build changes.

---

## What Self-Contained Means Per Platform

### Windows (x64, MSVC)

- The C runtime is linked **statically** (`/MT`). The `/MD` flag (dynamic CRT) must
  never be used in release builds. This means no dependency on `MSVCP140.dll`,
  `VCRUNTIME140.dll`, or any Visual C++ Redistributable.
- All third-party libraries (e.g. ada-url, reproc) must be built with the matching
  `x64-windows-static` vcpkg triplet. Using the default `x64-windows` triplet produces
  DLL dependencies and breaks the self-containment guarantee.
- The workflow passes `-DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows-static` explicitly — do not
  remove this flag.

### Linux (x64, GCC)

- `libgcc` and `libstdc++` are linked **statically** via `-static-libgcc
  -static-libstdc++`. This means the binary runs on any glibc-based distro
  (Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 11+, equivalents) without the user needing to install those
  packages separately.
- `glibc` itself remains **dynamic**. Do not attempt to link it statically — a
  statically linked glibc is not safe to redistribute and the dynamic ABI is stable and
  backward-compatible across all distributions we target.
- Do not add new `-shared` or `-Wl,-rpath` link flags that would introduce runtime
  library search paths.

### macOS (x86_64 and arm64)

- The binary relies on **only system-provided dylibs** (`libSystem`, `libc++`). These
  are present on every supported macOS version and do not need to be bundled.
- Do not link against Homebrew-installed shared libraries (`/usr/local/lib` or
  `/opt/homebrew/lib`). Such libraries are not present on users' machines and will
  cause a `dyld` error at launch.
- `-dead_strip` is passed to the linker to remove unused code — keep this flag.
- The deployment target is set to `macOS 12.0` (`-DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=12.0`).
  Do not lower this without careful testing, and do not raise it without updating the
  README's supported-platforms table.

## Dependency Management Rules

### Adding a new library

Before adding any dependency, ask: *can this be avoided with the C++17 standard library
or libraries already present?*

If a new library is genuinely necessary:

1. **Prefer header-only libraries** — they introduce no additional linking complexity.
2. **Use vcpkg** to manage it (add to `vcpkg.json`). Do not use system package managers
   (`apt`, `brew`, `choco`) inside the build — those libraries are not present on
   users' machines when they download a release binary.
3. **Verify static availability per platform.** Check that the vcpkg port supports
   static linking on all three platforms. If it only provides a shared library, look
   for an alternative.
4. **On Windows**, use the `x64-windows-static` triplet for every new library. If the
   library does not support static linking on Windows, it cannot be added without
   breaking the self-containment guarantee — raise this as a design question before
   proceeding.
5. **On macOS**, if a port links against a Homebrew dependency under
   `/usr/local` or `/opt/homebrew`, it is not safe to use without bundling or replacing
   that dependency.

### Removing a library

When removing a library, remove it from **both** `vcpkg.json` and the `find_package` /
`target_link_libraries` lines in `CMakeLists.txt`. Leaving stale entries in either file
causes build failures.

## Build System Rules

- **CMake minimum version is 3.20.** Do not lower it.
- **C++ standard is C++17.** Do not lower it. Raising to C++20 or later is acceptable
  if all platforms support it, but verify the GitHub Actions compiler versions first.
- **`CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS` is `OFF`** (disables compiler-specific extensions like
  `__int128` on MSVC). Keep it off to maintain portability.
- The vcpkg triplet for Windows (`VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET`) must be set **before** the
  `project()` call in `CMakeLists.txt` so the toolchain picks it up correctly. Do not
  move it below `project()`.
- CPack packaging is configured at the bottom of `CMakeLists.txt`. The workflow calls
  `cpack` directly (not via `cmake --build ... --target package` on all platforms) to
  produce the release archives. Do not change the archive format without updating the
  `upload-artifact` `path:` globs in the workflow.
- **`${PROJECT_NAME}` is the single source of truth for the executable name.** Every
  CMake command after `project()` — `add_executable`, `target_link_libraries`,
  `target_compile_options`, `target_link_options`, `install`, and
  `CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME` — uses `${PROJECT_NAME}`. Do not replace these references with
  a hardcoded string. The GitHub Actions workflow uses broad globs (`build/*.zip`,
  `build/*.tar.gz`) intentionally, so it stays correct after a rename without any
  workflow edits. Do not narrow those globs back to include a hardcoded name.

---

## Compiler Requirements

**Clang is required on all platforms.** Do not switch any platform back to a different
compiler without an explicit decision from the project owner.

| Platform | Compiler | How it is selected |
|---|---|---|
| Windows | clang-cl (LLVM frontend, MSVC-compatible) | `-T ClangCL` in the CMake configure step |
| Linux | Clang (`clang` / `clang++`) | `-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++` |
| macOS | Apple Clang | Default toolchain on the GitHub runner — no flag needed |

On Windows, clang-cl uses the MSVC linker and runtime, so `/MT` (static CRT) and the
`x64-windows-static` vcpkg triplet continue to apply unchanged. In CMake, `MSVC` is
`TRUE` when clang-cl is active — this is expected and correct; the existing `/MT`
replacement logic relies on it.

On Linux, `build-essential` is still installed alongside `clang` because it provides
supporting tools (`ar`, `ranlib`, etc.) that the Clang toolchain uses. The
`-static-libgcc` and `-static-libstdc++` link flags work with Clang on Linux exactly
as they do with GCC.

---

## GitHub Actions Workflow Rules

- All four build jobs (Windows, Linux, macOS x86_64, macOS arm64) must remain in sync
  — if you add a CMake flag or vcpkg setting to one job, add it to all of them unless
  there is a specific platform reason not to.
- vcpkg is provided by the GitHub-hosted runner via `$VCPKG_INSTALLATION_ROOT`. The
  "Setup vcpkg" step in each job exposes this as `$VCPKG_ROOT` and passes it to CMake
  via `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`. Do not replace this with a `git clone` of vcpkg unless
  you have a specific version-pinning requirement — the pre-installed version is kept
  up to date by GitHub.
- The release job only runs on `v*.*.*` tags. Do not change the trigger condition
  without considering the impact on the release workflow.
- Do not add steps that upload debug symbols, intermediate object files, or build logs
  as release assets — only the final packaged archives should appear in a release.

## Setup Instruction Quality Standards

When writing or updating "One-time setup" instructions in README.md or any other documentation, every tool entry must follow these rules:

### Detection steps must verify the desired state, not just existence

A detection command is only useful if it confirms that what's installed is actually sufficient for the build. Checking that a tool exists is not the same as checking that the right version is installed.

**Rules:**
1. Every tool detect step must state the **minimum required version** alongside the command.
2. If the tool's version number alone is ambiguous (e.g., Apple Clang uses different numbering than upstream LLVM), explain what the user should look for in the output.
3. If a tool is required to be on PATH to work (not just installed somewhere on disk), the detect step should confirm PATH availability, not just installation.
4. If the detect command succeeds but the version is too old, explicitly tell the user what to do (upgrade, not just install).

**Example of a bad detect step:**
```
- Detect: `clang-cl --version`
```
This only tells you clang-cl exists. It doesn't tell you if the version is new enough.

**Example of a good detect step:**
```
- Detect: `clang-cl --version` — must show version **14.0 or higher**. VS 2017 and VS 2019 ship older versions that will not work with the `-G "Visual Studio 17 2022"` CMake generator.
```

### Every required tool must have a detect step

Do not skip the detect step for any tool, even ones that seem obvious. The goal is that a developer on a clean machine can run each detect command top-to-bottom and know exactly which tools need to be installed.

### Installation hints over full instructions

Installation instructions tend to go out of date (URLs change, package names change). Prefer:
- A stable download page URL (e.g., the product's official page, not a direct download link)
- A package manager command (winget, brew, apt-get, pkg)
- A note about what options/workloads/components to select during install

Do not document every click in an installer wizard — those change with every release.

### Future automation readiness

These steps are written to be eventually automatable. Write them so a script could parse and execute them. That means:
- Each tool is a clearly separated entry
- Detect and install are clearly labeled
- Version requirements are explicit (so a script can compare versions)

---

## What Not to Do

- Do not add a runtime installer or an "install dependencies" step to the user-facing
  README — the whole point is that no such step is needed.
- Do not link against Qt, wxWidgets, or any other framework that requires the user to
  install a separate runtime.
- Do not use `find_package` with `REQUIRED` for system-installed packages (e.g.
  `find_package(OpenSSL REQUIRED)` without vcpkg) — system packages are not reliably
  present across all target OS versions.
- Do not change the deployment target or supported-platforms table without updating
  both the README and this file.
