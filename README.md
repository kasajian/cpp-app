## Purpose & Philosophy

The primary goal of this project is to provide a reliable base for C++ tools that "just work" everywhere. It solves the common C++ distribution problem where a binary works on the developer's machine but fails on another due to missing DLLs, incompatible runtimes, or mismatched library versions.

### Core Principles

1.  **Maximum Binary Self-Containment:** Every release binary is statically linked. Users can download a single file, extract it, and run it. No "Redistributable" installers or package managers are required for the end-user.
2.  **Cross-Platform Consistency:** By enforcing **Clang** and **vcpkg** across Windows, macOS, and Linux, we ensure that the same code behaves identically across all targets.
3.  **Modern C++ Foundation:** Built on **C++17**, integrating high-quality libraries like **Boost** (Asio, Beast, JSON, Filesystem, Program Options) and **Google Test**, providing a production-ready starting point.
4.  **Developer Autonomy:** The build system is designed to be modified easily. Renaming the project or adding new source files is a one-line change.

## Downloading a Release Binary

Pre-built binaries are published automatically on every tagged release.

1. Go to the [**Releases**](../../releases) page of this repository.
2. Expand the **Assets** section of the latest release.
3. Download the archive that matches your platform:

| Platform | File to download |
|---|---|
| Windows 64-bit | `cpp_app-<version>-win64.zip` |
| Linux 64-bit | `cpp_app-<version>-Linux.tar.gz` |
| Android ARM64 (Termux) | `cpp_app-<version>-Android.tar.gz` |
| WebAssembly (browser)  | `cpp_app-<version>-wasm.tar.gz` — extract and open `cpp_app.html` in any modern browser |
| macOS Intel (x86_64) | `cpp_app-<version>-Darwin-x86_64.tar.gz` |
| macOS Apple Silicon (arm64) | `cpp_app-<version>-Darwin-arm64.tar.gz` |

---

## Running the Application

### Windows

1. Extract the `.zip` archive (right-click → *Extract All…*).
2. Open a **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** window.
3. Navigate to the extracted folder.
4. Run the application:
   ```cmd
   cpp_app.exe
   ```

### macOS

1. Open **Terminal**.
2. Extract the archive:
   ```bash
   tar -xzf cpp_app-<version>-Darwin-*.tar.gz
   ```
3. Navigate into the extracted folder and run:
   ```bash
   ./cpp_app
   ```
   > **First-time Gatekeeper prompt:** macOS may block unsigned binaries.  
   > If you see *"cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified"*,  
   > right-click the binary in Finder and choose **Open**, then click **Open** in the dialog.  
   > Alternatively, from Terminal: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./cpp_app`

### Linux

1. Open a terminal.
2. Extract the archive:
   ```bash
   tar -xzf cpp_app-<version>-Linux.tar.gz
   ```
3. Navigate into the extracted folder and run:
   ```bash
   ./cpp_app
   ```
   The binary is statically linked against `libgcc` and `libstdc++` so it runs on any reasonably modern glibc-based system (Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 11+, and equivalents) without installing additional packages.

### Android (Termux)

1. Open **Termux**.
2. Download the archive (e.g., using `curl -L <url> -o cpp_app.tar.gz`).
3. Extract the archive:
   ```bash
   tar -xzf cpp_app.tar.gz
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./cpp_app
   ```
   The binary is built with the Android NDK and statically links the C++ standard library, allowing it to run natively within the Termux environment.

## Building from Source

This project uses **Clang** on all platforms and **vcpkg** for dependency management.
Follow the one-time setup for your platform, then the build steps are identical
everywhere.

---

### Windows

**One-time setup**

**Git**
Detect: `git --version`
Install: Download from https://git-scm.com/download/win or `winget install Git.Git`

**Visual Studio 2022**
Detect: `clang-cl --version` — if this works, the required VS components are present.
Install: Download [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and select during install:
- Workload: *Desktop development with C++*
- Individual component: *C++ Clang tools for Windows* (installs `clang-cl` and `llvm-objcopy`)

> **Note:** CMake is bundled with Visual Studio — no separate CMake install needed.

**vcpkg**
Detect: `echo $env:VCPKG_ROOT` (PowerShell) — if this prints a path, vcpkg is configured.
Also check: `vcpkg version`
Install:
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git C:\vcpkg
C:\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat -disableMetrics
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("VCPKG_ROOT", "C:\vcpkg", "User")
$env:VCPKG_ROOT = "C:\vcpkg"
```

**Node.js** *(optional — only needed for WebAssembly smoke testing)*
Detect: `node --version`
Install: Download from https://nodejs.org or `winget install OpenJS.NodeJS`

**ast-grep** *(optional — recommended for code search and refactoring)*
Detect: `sg --version`
Install: `npm install -g @ast-grep/cli` (requires Node.js)

**Configure and build** (PowerShell)

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
cd <your-repo>\cpp-app

cmake -S . -B build `
  -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -T ClangCL `

cmake --build build --parallel
```

The binary is at `build/bin/cpp_app`.

**Running unit tests**

```bash
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

---

### Android (Termux)

**One-time setup**

**Build tools**
Detect each: `git --version`, `cmake --version`, `clang --version`, `ninja --version`
Install: `pkg update && pkg install -y git cmake clang ninja python`

**vcpkg**
Detect: `echo $VCPKG_ROOT`
Install:
```bash

cmake --build build --parallel
```

The binary is at `build/bin/cpp_app`.

**Running unit tests**

> **Note:** Tests cannot be run when cross-compiling from a non-Android host (the
> binary targets Bionic ABI). If building natively in Termux on an Android device,
> run: `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure`

> **vcpkg first run:** The first configure will download and compile all dependencies
> (including Boost) from source. This takes several minutes. Subsequent builds are
> fast because vcpkg caches the compiled packages.

---

### Other platforms

Pre-built binaries are provided for Windows x64, Linux x64, macOS Intel, and macOS
Apple Silicon. If you are on a different system, building from source is the supported
path.

**FreeBSD**

The Linux build instructions above transfer directly. Replace the `apt-get` step with the FreeBSD package manager:
`pkg install cmake ninja llvm`

Clang is the default compiler on FreeBSD (10+). vcpkg has known-working support on FreeBSD. Use the same CMake configure command as Linux, substituting `clang` and `clang++` as shown.

**WebAssembly**

> **Note:** The CTest unit test runner cannot execute WebAssembly binaries natively.
> The Emscripten output can be smoke-tested via Node.js:
> `node build/bin/cpp_app.js`

---

## Renaming the Project and Executable

Change **one line** in **one file** — the first argument of `project()` in
`CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
project(my_app          ← change this to your chosen name
    VERSION 1.0.0
    DESCRIPTION "Cross-platform C++ console application"
    LANGUAGES CXX
)
```

That is the only edit required. CMake stores this name in the built-in variable
`${PROJECT_NAME}`, and every other command in `CMakeLists.txt` already uses that
variable — `add_executable`, `target_link_libraries`, `install`, and the CPack archive
name. The GitHub Actions workflow uses broad filename globs (`build/*.zip`,
`build/*.tar.gz`) so it picks up the renamed archives automatically.

After the edit, delete your `build/` folder and re-run CMake from scratch so the new
name is applied cleanly:

```bash
rm -rf build
cmake -S . -B build \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="$VCPKG_ROOT/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"
cmake --build build --parallel
# Binary is now at build/bin/my_app  (or my_app.exe on Windows)
```

> **`vcpkg.json` `"name"` field:** This is cosmetic metadata used only to identify
> the manifest to vcpkg. It has no effect on the binary name or build output. You can
> optionally update it to match, but it is not required. If you do update it, vcpkg
> names must be all-lowercase with hyphens (e.g. `"my-app"`).

---

## Adding Source Files (Modules)

CMake does not scan your source folder automatically. Every new `.cpp` file must be
registered in `CMakeLists.txt` or it will silently not be compiled. Header files
require no registration — create them anywhere in `src/` and `#include` them as normal.

### Step 1 — Create your files

Place them anywhere inside `src/`. A flat layout works fine for small projects; use
sub-folders for larger ones.

```
src/
├── main.cpp
├── my_module.cpp   ← new
└── my_module.h     ← new (no CMake entry needed)
```

### Step 2 — Register the `.cpp` file in `CMakeLists.txt`

Find the `target_sources` block (just below `add_executable`) and add one line:

```cmake
target_sources(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE
    src/main.cpp
    src/my_module.cpp   ← add this line
)
```

Header files (`.h`, `.hpp`) are **not** listed here. CMake finds them automatically
when your code `#include`s them.

### Step 3 — Rebuild

No need to delete the build folder for this change — CMake detects the updated source
list on the next build:

```bash
cmake --build build --parallel
```

That's all. The new module will be compiled and linked into the executable.

---

## Adding Boost Libraries

Boost components are managed in two places: `vcpkg.json` (which packages to install) and `CMakeLists.txt` (how to link them). Both files must be updated together.

### Step 1 — Find the vcpkg package name

Each Boost library is its own vcpkg package named `boost-<library>`.  
Common examples:

| Boost library | vcpkg package name |
|---|---|
| Boost.Filesystem | `boost-filesystem` |
| Boost.Regex | `boost-regex` |
| Boost.Asio | `boost-asio` |
| Boost.Json | `boost-json` |
| Boost.Program_options | `boost-program-options` |
| Boost.Thread | `boost-thread` |
| Boost.Beast (HTTP/WebSocket) | `boost-beast` |

To search for others: `vcpkg search boost`

### Step 2 — Add the package to `vcpkg.json`

Open `vcpkg.json` at the root of the `cpp-app/` folder and add the package name to the `"dependencies"` array:

```json
{
  "name": "cpp-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": [
    "boost-filesystem",
    "boost-regex"
  ]
}
```

### Step 3 — Update `CMakeLists.txt`

Find the `find_package` line for Boost and add your new component to the `COMPONENTS` list, then add the corresponding `Boost::<component>` target to `target_link_libraries`.

**Before:**
```cmake
find_package(Boost REQUIRED COMPONENTS filesystem)
target_link_libraries(cpp_app PRIVATE Boost::filesystem)
```

**After:**
```cmake
find_package(Boost REQUIRED COMPONENTS filesystem regex)
target_link_libraries(cpp_app PRIVATE Boost::filesystem Boost::regex)
```

The CMake target name is always `Boost::` followed by the component name in lowercase (e.g. `Boost::regex`, `Boost::thread`, `Boost::program_options`).

### Step 4 — Include the header in your source file

```cpp
#include <boost/regex.hpp>   // example
```

### Step 5 — Re-run CMake

vcpkg reads `vcpkg.json` automatically during the CMake configure step. Just re-run configure and the new library will be downloaded, built, and linked:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="$VCPKG_ROOT/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"
cmake --build build --parallel
```

**CI is handled automatically.** When you push the updated `vcpkg.json` and `CMakeLists.txt`, the GitHub Actions workflow installs the new library on all four platform/architecture runners before building.

---

## CI / CD Pipeline

The pipeline has three trigger modes:

| Trigger | Jobs that run | Release published? |
|---|---|---|
| Push to `main` | Linux only (build + unit tests) | No |
| Manual dispatch (see below) | All 6 platforms | No |
| `v*.*.*` tag push | All 6 platforms | **Yes** |

**Why Linux only on push to `main`?** macOS runners cost 10× the minutes of Linux
runners under GitHub's billing model. Linux with Clang catches the vast majority of
bugs. Full cross-platform validation is reserved for deliberate actions.

### Triggering a manual dispatch

Go to your repository on GitHub → **Actions** tab → select **"Build and Release"** →
click **"Run workflow"** → click the green **"Run workflow"** button. All 6 platform
builds run; no release is created.

Use this when you want to validate that everything still compiles on all platforms
without publishing a release (e.g. after a period of inactivity, or before tagging).

### Creating a release

Tag the commit you want to release and push the tag:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

GitHub Actions will:
1. Build on all 6 platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS x86_64, macOS arm64, Android, WebAssembly).
2. Run unit tests on all native platforms; Wine compatibility test on the Windows binary.
3. Package each binary into an archive.
4. Create a GitHub Release named **"Release v1.0.0"** with all archives attached.

To delete a tag if you made a mistake before pushing:
```bash
git tag -d v1.0.0            # delete locally
git push origin :v1.0.0      # delete from GitHub
```

---

## Developer Tools

### Recommended editor setup

[**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) works well on all platforms.
Install these extensions:

| Extension | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ms-vscode.cmake-tools` | CMake configure/build/test integration |
| `llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd` | Code completion, navigation, diagnostics via clangd |
| `ms-vscode.cpptools` | Debugger (MSVC/GDB/LLDB) |

On Windows, **Visual Studio 2022** itself is also a fully supported IDE — open
the folder directly and it detects `CMakeLists.txt` automatically.

### ast-grep — structural code search and rewrite

[`ast-grep`](https://ast-grep.github.io/) (`sg`) is a fast, AST-aware code
search and transformation tool. Unlike `grep` or regex-based tools, it
understands code structure — it will never match text inside string literals or
comments, and it handles nested templates and complex expressions correctly.
It is the recommended tool for any large-scale code modifications in this
project (renaming types, adding/removing qualifiers, changing call signatures).

**Install:**

```bash
# macOS
brew install ast-grep

# Windows (via npm — requires Node.js)
npm install -g @ast-grep/cli

# Any platform via Cargo (requires Rust)
cargo install ast-grep
```

**Example — find all uses of a type across the codebase:**
```bash
sg --pattern 'boost::system::error_code' --lang cpp src/
```

**Example — rename a function across all C++ files:**
```bash
sg --pattern 'old_function_name($ARGS)' \
   --rewrite 'new_function_name($ARGS)' \
   --lang cpp src/
```

---

## Developer Checklist (Before You Push)

Every developer making a code change is expected to, at minimum, do the following
before pushing:

1. **Build for your local platform.** You don't need to cross-compile for all targets —
   CI handles that. But your local build must succeed cleanly with no new warnings.
2. **Run the unit tests.** Use the `ctest` command for your platform (see
   *Running Unit Tests* above). All tests must pass.
3. **Update documentation.** If your change affects build steps, supported platforms,
   library list, CI jobs, minimum OS versions, or any other documented behaviour:
   update `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and/or `AGENTS.md` accordingly. Do not leave
   documentation stale.
4. **Let CI be the cross-platform gate.** Push to `main` — the pipeline runs Linux
   build + unit tests automatically. When you want full cross-platform validation,
   trigger a manual dispatch from the GitHub Actions tab. A `v*.*.*` tag push runs
   everything and publishes a release.

> AI agents are subject to the same checklist. See `AGENTS.md` for the enforcement
> rule.
